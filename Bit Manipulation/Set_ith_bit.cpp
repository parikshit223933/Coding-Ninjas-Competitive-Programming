/* You are given two integers N and i. You need to make ith bit of binary representation of N to 1 and return the updated N.
Counting of bits start from 0 from right to left.
Input Format :
Two integers N and i (separated by space)
Output Format :
Updated N
Sample Input 1 :
4 1
Sample Output 1 :
6
Sample Input 2 :
4 4
Sample Output 2 :
20 */
